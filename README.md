# Multi-Step Form (SMIT Assignment)

This project is a **Multi-Step Form** built using **HTML, CSS.**.  
It was created as part of my **Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT)** course assignment.  
The form collects user data across multiple pages and ends with a confirmation ("Thank You") page.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → For structure and semantic layout  
- **CSS3** → For design, alignment, and responsiveness  
- **Font Awesome** → For icons (arrows, check marks, etc.)

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user fills out the **Account page** and clicks **Next**.  
2. On the next pages, the user provides **Personal Details** and **Review Information**.  
3. After submission, a **Thank You page** appears confirming the form submission.  

Each step uses navigation links to move forward or backward between pages.

## 📱 Responsiveness

- The form automatically adjusts to different screen sizes using:
  - `min-width`
  - `max-width`
  - `min-height`
  - `max-height`

No media queries are used — the layout is **fully flexible** by design.
